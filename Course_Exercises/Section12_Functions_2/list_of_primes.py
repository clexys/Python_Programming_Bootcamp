    # False and statements inside the body of if are executed.

# Lastly, we created a variable called max_num_to_check that will take the input.

# Then, we define that our empty list_of_primes will contain what we get from max_num_to_check

# Finally, we cycle thru our list and store the info into prime and we print it
