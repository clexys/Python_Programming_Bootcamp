# List Comprehensions

# You can construct lists in interesting ways using list comprehensions
# You can do this by performing an operation on each item in the list

# 2, 3, 4

# Create a 10 x 10 list

# Change a value in the multidimensional list

# Get the 2nd item in the 1st list
# It may help to think of it as the 2nd item in the 1st row

# Get the 2nd item in the 2nd list
print(multi_d_list[1][1])

# Multidimensional Lists
#
# Multidimensional list are tables of data that spans across rows and columns
# Here Iâ€™ll show how indexes work with a multidimensional list

# Create the multidimensional list 10 x 10
list_table = [[0] * 10 for i in range(10)]

# Fill the list with values
for i in range(10):

Python Problem for you to Solve

With 2 for loops fill the cells in a multidimensional list with a multiplication table using values 1 - 9. This is your goal.

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18,
3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27,
4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36,
5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45,
6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54,
7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63,
8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72,
