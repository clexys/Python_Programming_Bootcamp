Casting and Adding
To solve this problem
Don't use the input function in this code
1. Create 2 variables named num_1 and num_2
2. Assign a number string to each of the variable (Ex. "5")
Output the addition of those 2 variables using this format 1 + 2 = 3
'''
# Variables num_1 and num_2 and assign number strings 1 and 2
num_1="1"
num_2="2"
# output addition as 1 + 2 = 3
print(num_1,"+",num_2,"=",(int(num_1)+int(num_2)))
